## Dependencies

This application utilizes older versions from packages. For that reason, we suggest the creation of isolated Python environments using virtualenv (https://virtualenv.pypa.io) to install such versions.

To install virtualenv run the command:

```python
pip install virtualenv
```

Then create your environment:

```python
virtualenv ENV
```

To run your environment:

```python
source activate
```

To install the versions of the packages:

```python
pip install flask==0.12
pip install flask-login==0.3.2
```

You will also need to install nltk (https://www.nltk.org/):


```python
pip install nltk
```
