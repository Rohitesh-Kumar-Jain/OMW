Overall:
 * check new code on all wordnets, encourage people to reupload

Interface:
 * concept-list.html
 ** check what will happen with supercede
 ** link src  (project/key 🌐 external if it exists)
 ** link concept in OMW 🕸
http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/iliomw/omw/concepts/ili/46360

** link used by
 ** show time remaining
(mousing over ILI id shows concept but it flickers)

 ** jump to summary of the uploaded wordnet

 * concept.html

Welcome
 * fix the show all projects if (in omw_welcome)

Validation:
 * do we want to check it is a new version (not just unknown)?	


 * in loading
 ** add reverse if it is not there
 ** meta attributes for links (type, comment)

return non-html for search

better search: +pos, +sf, +hypernym, +two words

Label
things with names:
 --- most common lemma in L1 (alphabetical for ties)
 if None
 --- most common synset name in src (for ILI)
 if None
--- most common name in oldest project?


Add ILIdef (if it exists)
(Same with definitions)?
